                            <p>As I write this Testimonial, I can now report that Skipper and I made the journey by plane to the Sanctuary safely, and he is now in the process of acclimating. He spent the first few weeks in his own cage under cover and has been doing well. The most exciting update is that Skipper was recently moved into a new cage with a female Blue-Crowned Conure that he has been courting, and they seem to have made a wonderful connection. This could be a match made in heaven and was music to my ears! My dream of Skipper living a freer life in the company of birds is being realized!</p>

                            <p>When the time came to leave, I took Perikeen and kissed him goodbye, told him I loved him and tossed him up into the air. He flew across the cage and landed on the opposite side of the enclosure – it was the first time I’d seen him actually fly in all of his eighteen years. He was a real bird, now – finally – and my heart expanded with the joy of it. Knowing that, even though it wasn’t the life he was made for – flying free, foraging and living in the jungles of South America, it was so much closer to that life than he’d ever been before – closer than I would have ever been able to get him without the FEBS and their wonderful, knowledgeable and caring staff.</p>
