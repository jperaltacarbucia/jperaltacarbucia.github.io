<p>The card game is a turn based game where players start with 8000 points and play their cards to lower their opponent’s points to 0. Each player has their respective decks of 40-60 cards, and an extra deck from 0-15 cards. They shuffle their opponent’s deck and then set their respective decks on the lower right side of the field. Then draw 5 cards to begin.</p>
<p>Decide who goes first. Whichever player goes first gets to begin by entering the Phases: Draw Phase, Standby Phase, Main Phase 1, Battle Phase, Main Phase 2, and End Phase.</p>
<p>Draw Phase is the first step, where the player draws 1 card from their deck. Then it moves to their Standby Phase; this phase only works to activate certain card effects, if there is no effect to activate, move on to the next phase. Main Phase 1.</p>
<p>Main Phase 1 is where you do almost everything. During this phase you can normal summon a monster, activate spell cards, switch the positions of your monsters, activate effects, and special summon monsters, set traps, set spells, and more.</p>
<p>If its not the first turn you can enter Battle Phase, the key to winning is reducing your opponent’s life points down to zero. Use your monsters ATK power to attack your opponent and win the duel. You can only attack with a monster once per turn, so is 1 attack per monster. Some monsters have the effect to attack twice, so that is the only way to be able to attack 2 times with 1 monster. Also some traps or spell cards would help attack more than once, or power up your attack. You can’t use spells or traps from your hand or field during this turn unless the trap is already set for a turn and the spell card are Quick-Spell.</p>
<p>Then you can choose to go to another Main Phase 2, or just move directly to the End Phase, so your opponent gets his turn, starting from Draw Phase again.</p>
<p>That’s the basic gameplay of Yugioh TCG. Now I should explain the field and the field format on where you play the cards. First the field is a rectangle with 2x7 sections for you to put your cards. The Deck goes at the lower right side of the field; on top of that is the Graveyard, where all the used and destroyed cards go to. Then to the right are 5 spots that all look the same, this spots are the Monster Card Zone, where you put your monster cards. Under each of the Monster Zone, you will see a Spell and Trap Card Zone, which is where you play your Spell and Trap cards. At the lower left is the Extra Deck, where your Fusions and Synchros are (You place them face-down just like your Deck). At the top of the Extra Deck is the Field Card Zone, where only field spell cards can be set or activated. Both players will have a field to play in.<br />
