<p>Trap cards are the red colored cards. These cards can be activated in response to summon, an effect, activation, or almost anything. Trap cards must be set first before activation (Meaning, you need to wait until you end your turn before you get to use the trap card.) After the trap has been set for 1 turn, you can activate it in any other turn, either yours or your opponent as long as the effect applies. There are 3 types of trap cards: Normal, Continuous, and Counter.</p>
<p>Normal trap cards must be set before use. After they are set, you can use them in any turn as long as the effect applies.</p>
<p>Continuous trap cards must be set before use. After they are set, you can activate them any time you want and the trap card stays on the field activated until it’s destroyed. The effect of the trap card applies on the field until it’s destroyed.</p>
<p>Counter trap cards must be set before use. After they are set, you can activate them in reaction to an effect, summon, an activation, and they can’t no other effect can be activated unless is a counter trap card as well. (Basically counter trap cards are stronger when it comes to chaining effects and activations)<br />
