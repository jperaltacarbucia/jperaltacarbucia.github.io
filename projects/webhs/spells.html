<p>Spell cards are the green colored cards, this cards can be used only on your turn unless they are quick-spell cards. There are 6 types of spell cards: Normal, Quick-Spell, Continuous, Equip, Field, and Ritual.</p>
<p>Normal spell cards can be activated in your turn during main phase only. You just do what the description of the card says.</p>
<p>Quick-Spell cards can be activated anytime during your turn. You can set this card face-down on your side of the field and activate it on your opponent’s turn anytime.</p>
<p>Continuous spell cards get activated on the field and they stay there face-up. The effect in the description of the card stays activated for you or your opponent (Read effect of your spell card to see to whom does it applies) as long as the spell card is activated on the field. If someone destroys the spell card the effect stops.</p>
<p>Equip spell cards can be equipped to any monster on the field, or yours mainly. You leave this card activated on the field just like a continuous spell card, as long as is equipped to a monster. If the monster is destroyed, the equip spell card is also destroyed. But if the equip spell card is destroyed, the monster is not destroyed, unless the equip spell card says so.</p>
<p>Field spell cards are activated at the corner of the field and give an effect that works for both players. When a new field spell card is activated (From either side) the field spell card that is activated gets destroyed. If the field spell card was set, it doesn’t get destroyed. Even though Field spell cards are spell cards, you don’t play them on the Spell Card Zone, you play them on the Field Card Zone. (See How to Play section to know more about Spell Card Zone and Field Card Zone.)</p>
<p>Ritual spell cards were already covered basically on the ritual monster section. Ritual spell cards are cards that let you special summon a specific ritual monster by tributing monsters on the field with the exact level or more than the ritual monster that you will summon. Also the ritual monster should be on your hand when you activate this card or the ritual spell card can’t be used.<br />
