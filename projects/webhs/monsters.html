<p>The most important cards in the game of Yugioh are the monsters, because they have the power to lower your opponent’s life points with their ATK (Attack) or defend your life points with their DEF (Defense). All monsters have a level/rank, ATK, and DEF; monsters can be summoned either in ATK (Face-Up upright) or DEF (Face-Down Sideways) mode. Once per turn you can normal summon 1 monster, unless you activate a card that let’s you special summon more monsters that turn. You can normal summon monsters level 4 or lower only; if you want to summon more powerful monsters such as level 5 or 6, you will need to tribute (destroy) 1 monster on your side of the field; if you want to summon a even more powerful monster such as level 7 or 8 you will need to tribute 2 monsters on your side of the field. If you want to destroy an opposing monster, you must have more ATK than your opponent’s ATK or DEF (Depends in which mode your opponent played his or her monster). If your ATK is lower than your opponent’s ATK, your monster is destroyed and you lose life points depending on the difference. If your ATK is lower than your opponent’s DEF, you lose life points depending on the difference but your monster is not destroyed. Monster cards can also have an effect which is in their description; this can give you advantage in the game.</p>
<p>Monsters have 7 attributes: Dark, Divine, Earth, Fire, Light, Water, Wind; and a big list of types: Aqua, Beast, Beast-Warrior, Dinosaur, Divine-Beast, Dragon, Fairy, Fiend, Fish, Insect, Machine, Plant, Psychic, Pyro, Reptile, Rock, Sea Serpent, Spellcaster, Spirit, Thunder, Tuner, Warrior, Winged Beast, and Zombie.</p>
<p>There are about 5 types of monsters: Normal/Tribute, Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz. Normal/Effect monsters are Yellow/Orange colored. You can summon 1 of these monster once per turn, unless it gets special summoned by another card. They will be colored orange when they have effects. For activating a monster effect, you just do what it says on the description, simple as that.</p>
<p>The next type of monster is the Fusion monster, which is Purple colored. Fusion monsters are stored in the Extra Deck (This will be explained in the “How to Play” section). To special summon a fusion you have to use a fusion summon card such as “Polymerization”. Fusion summon cards let’s you select 2 monsters and combine them to summon 1 fusion monster.</p>
<p>Next are the Ritual monsters, which are colored Blue. Ritual monsters need a ritual spell card to be summoned. Ritual monsters can only be summoned from your hand while you use the ritual spell card. The point with this type of summoning is that you must tribute monsters to the same level of the ritual monster. The monster you tribute can be from either your hand or the field; BUT you must have the ritual spell and ritual monster in your hand.</p>
<p>One of the top favorites monsters are the white colored Synchro monsters. These monsters are also kept in the Extra Deck. In order to summon this type of monster you need a “Tuner” type monster and 1 or more non-tuner type monsters. When you Synchro summon you add the levels of the tuner and the non-tuner monsters and you will be able to Synchro summon a monster of that level. Some Synchro monsters need specific tuners such as “Junk Warrior” needs “Junk Synchron”.</p>
<p>The last monster type is the new Xyz which is colored black with a galaxy background. With this new type of cards you overlay cards on top of each other instead of sending them to the grave like the fusions, rituals, and synchros. <br />
