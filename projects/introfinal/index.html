Hi, my name is <strong>Joshua Peralta</strong>. I was born in <strong>Puerto Rico</strong>, <strong>March 23 1994</strong>, and lived there for 12 years, although my family has been there since <u><em>1984</em></u>. When I started school, I started at home, with the home-schooling program, with my mother as teacher. I've been home-schooled my whole life, up till I enter college. In <u><em>2006</em></u> we moved to <em><strong><u>Orlando Florida</u></strong></em> and have been living there ever since. I was still home-schooled, but in high school I joined the online <u><em>FLVS</em></u> and then <u><em>Connexus</em></u> home-schooling programs. In <strong>March 22, 2009</strong> I got baptized and became a <u><em>Christian</em></u>. When I finished High School at 18, I went to college in <strong>Valencia</strong>. That was my first experience of taking classes out of my house by myself. I've never been the type of person to socialize, so this was quite something new. Although I'm much of a nerd guy, you can always or mostly find me in the <u><em>computer</em></u> or on my <u><em>gaming consoles</em></u>. I did alright on the first semester, getting myself up in the <em><u>Dean's Honor Students</u></em>. I finished the second semester and this is the end of the third semester, with this site as my Final. </p>

This is the <strong>Image Project</strong> which was edited by using Adobe Photoshop. In this collage a bunch of different pictures were taken and put together as a collage to represent a day in Valencia College. With all the different effects that Photoshop offers you, images can look amazing when edited. To go back to the top of the page, click <a href="#logo">here</a>.
