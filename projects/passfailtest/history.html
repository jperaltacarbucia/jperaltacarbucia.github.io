        	<h2>Historic Petra</h2>

        	<p id="text1">The ancient Nabataean city of Petra, in the southern part of the Kingdom 160 miles from Amman, is Jordan's most famous tourist attraction. Known as the "rose red city", it was once a fortress, carved out of craggy rocks in an area which was virtually inaccessible.</p>

          <h2>The Nabataeans</h2>


           <p>The city was first settled in about 800B.C. by the Nabataean tribe from northern Arabia, the city reached the peak of its fame in the second century, under Roman rule. The Nabataeans were builders of great skill, carving their city from the living rock. Working from the top down, they sliced off huge slabs of stone, using the two-meter ledge thus formed as scaffolding for the masons to stand on. Entablatures and capitals were carved before another slab was removed in the same way, to make another platform, from which facades and columns were carved and the deep chambers beyond were hollowed out. In this way, the builders were able to descend ten stories to the valley floor below. A succession of habitation, leadership and development followed but, as the caravan routes were slowly displaced by shipping, the city's importance gradually dwindled; it fell into disuse and was lost to the world for over a thousand years. </p>

          <h2>Rediscovery of Petra</h2>

           <p>Hidden away amidst the folds of spectacular hills, Petra was lost to Europeans until it was rediscovered in 1812 by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. After spending several years learning Arabic and studying the tenets of Islam, Burckhardt, who passed himself off as a Muslim from India, set out on his journey under the auspices of the London-based "Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior parts of Africa".</p>

           <p>In route to Cairo, through the area of what is now Jordan, his fluent Arabic enabled him to understand stories of a wondrous ancient city hidden away amongst impenetrable mountains. However, he needed a plausible excuse to gain access to the city without arousing any suspicion as to his real intentions. By claiming he wished to make a sacrifice at the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, which was nearby, he gained entry to the forgotten city of Petra.</p>

           <p>One can imagine the impression the ruins made upon him, for he was fully able to appreciate the importance of his discovery and correctly identify the city as ancient Petra. In spite of the fact that he was obliged to conceal his interest and excitement from his guides, Burckhardt recorded what he had seen, and his account, published in 1822 was to excite great interest in Europe and inspire a long line of travelers to visit the site.</p>

           <h2>Modern Petra</h2>

           <p>Petra is approached through a narrow, deep gorge or siq, which winds for about 1km through a massive wall of rock. This is at some points less than three meters wide and its vertical walls tower to a height of 70 meters, making Petra one of the best-defended cities of all time.</p>

           <p>At the end of the siq appears the impressive monument of el Khazneh, the Treasury. This is an enormous royal tomb, which was carved out of solid rock in the side of the mountain. Beyond this, a stairway cut in the rock takes the visitor to rock-carved streets lined with hundreds of temples, royal tombs, large and small houses, banqueting halls, water channels and reservoirs, baths, monumental staircases, markets, arched gates, public buildings and paved streets. There is also a gigantic Roman theatre, seating 3,000.</p>

           <p>Visitors can reach Petra from Amman by the Desert Highway, a journey which takes about three hours. Travelling by the King's Highway, which is an historic scenic, winding road, takes much longer -- a minimum of five hours. From Aqaba, the drive is about 82 miles (133km), but as the highway usually has heavy traffic, visitors should allow plenty of time if using this route.
